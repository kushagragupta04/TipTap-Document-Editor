## Why Choose Tiptap Editor?

Most web-based editors treat content as a single, continuous scroll, leading to "print anxiety"—the fear that what you see on screen won't match the final PDF.

**Tiptap Editor is different.**

*   **Page-First Architecture**: We don't just simulate pages; the editor understands physical paper boundaries in real-time.
*   **Eliminate Formatting Fatigue**: Stop wasting hours fighting with broken tables and orphaned headers. Our engine handles the layout logic so you can focus on the argument.
*   **Zero-Config Compliance**: We are opinionated by design. The editor loads with the exact settings required for court submissions, so you can't accidentally break the format.

## Getting Started

To get the editor running locally:

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

*   **Edit Content**: Just type as you would in any word processor.
*   **Insert Elements**: Use the toolbar to add tables, images, or lists.
*   **Print/Export**: Click the print icon in the toolbar or use standard browser print shortcuts (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) to generate a perfectly formatted PDF.
